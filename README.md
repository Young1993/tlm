# TLM: Token-Level Masking for Transformers (EMNLP2023)

The public code.\
In this paper, we propose a new regularization scheme based on token-level rather than structure-level to reduce
overfitting. Specifically, we devise a novel Token-Level Masking (TLM) training strategy for Transformers to regularize
the connections of self-attention, which consists of two masking techniques that are effective and easy to implement.
The underlying idea is to manipulate the connections between tokens in the multi-head attention via masking, where the
networks are forced to exploit partial neighbors’ information to produce a meaningful representation.

## Note

we release the code => BERT-base (bert-base-cased) with TLM on RTE

- if you do not use attention dropout, set attention_probs_dropout_prob=0
- if you do not use tlm, set --use_tlm=0

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Young1993/tlm.git
cd tlm/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Use TLM

```shell
cd glue
sh bert-base_sh/rte_train_tlm.sh
```

### without TLM

cd glue sh bert-base_sh/rte_train.sh

### Notice

If you plan to apply tlm to decoder-only architecture, you can reference to the code in
./transformers/models/bert/modeling_bert.py.

# Todo

- ✅ Run Bert-base with TLM.
- To test QWen/LLama/sqlcoder with TLM.
- To pull requests code into Transformers.
